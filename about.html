       <div id="about-text">
        <p>Hello there! <b>I am a fifth-semester student pursuing a double major in Computer
            Science and Statistics at Binus University.</b> I am deeply passionate about coding
            and machine learning, which has sparked my interest in web development and
            data analysis. Despite their differences, I strongly believe that combining these
            areas can make a meaningful impact, particularly in decision-making processes.<br><br>
            My academic journey has fueled my enthusiasm for technology and data-driven
            insights. I continuously seek opportunities to expand my skills in building robust
            web applications and drawing meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.
            <b>My goal is to develop innovative solutions that bring about positive change and
            contribute to better decision-making.</b></p>
